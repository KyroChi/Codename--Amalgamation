# __Implementation and Usage__

### Setting up GitHub client:
* Download the client here: https://windows.github.com/ or here: https://mac.github.com/
* Clone the project to your computer with this url: https://github.com/KyroChi/UnityProject

### Opening the project in Unity:
* To open in unity, drag the 'UnityProject' folder into your project's assets folder
* Any changes you make will be pushed to the client where you can sync them to the master project
* If you are going to make large changes or an experimental build please fork the master repository

### Project Guidelines
* Do not preform major changes in master without consulting with other members, making a fork is Okay
* This project is written in C#, please stick with C#
* Upload finished or placeholder assets only to the repository (meshes, audio, ect), WIP and transisional assets should be uploaded to Google Drive
* Update the changelog with any significant progress to development
* Update Readme and other assets as often as possible
* Do not push unfinished or broken code to the repository

### Known bugs and operating nuances:
* Must export scenes and prefabs as a package through dropbox
* Scenes may not sync properly through GitHub, make a backup elsewhere as scenes may be erased during sync. Problem will be addressed in the near future
* Prefabs do not sync properly either. This problem will also be addressed whenever a viable solution is presented
